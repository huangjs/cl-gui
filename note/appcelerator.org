* Extensions to Webkit

- Full filesystem access allows you to read and manage files in a more
  web-independent way.

- Internal SQLite database access makes storing local data a simple
  task.

- While AJAX is still available, the network API allows you to
  interface with HTTP at a much lower level, or even open socket
  connections to other services manually.

- Titanium includes wrappers around Desktop features such as
  notifications, tray icons, and window menus so you can create more
  natural applications for all major operating systems.
